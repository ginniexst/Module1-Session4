    <h1>What is CSS?</h1>
    <p class="para1">
        Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is used to format the layout of a webpage.
    </p>

    <p style="color: palevioletred;">
        With CSS, you can control the color, font, the size of text, the spacing between elements, how elements are
        positioned and laid out, what background images or background colors are to be used, different displays for
        devices and screen sizes, and much more!
    </p>

    <p class="para3">
        <b>Tips:</b> The word <b>cascading</b> means that a style applied to a parent element will also apply to all
        children element within the parent. So, if you set the color of the body text to "blue", all headings,
        paragraphs, and other text elements within the body also get the same color (unless you specify something else)!
